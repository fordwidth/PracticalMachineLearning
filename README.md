# PracticalMachineLearning

The project goal was to predict a correct exercise movement using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. Participants performed one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different ways: "correctly" (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D), throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Using machine learning methods we predict the class of movement in 20 cases based on accelerometer input data.
